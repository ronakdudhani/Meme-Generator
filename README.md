# Meme Generator
This is an Android app built with Flutter that allows users to upload their own images, add text over them, and customize the text's color, size, font, and style to create custom memes. Users can then share the resulting meme on social media or save it to their device for future use.

## Features
- Upload custom images: Users can select an image from their device's gallery to use as the background for the meme.
- Add text: Users can enter their own text to appear on top of the image, with the option to adjust the font, size, color, and style of the text.
- Customize the meme: Users can adjust the size and position of the text.
- Share or save: Once the meme is created, users can choose to share it directly on social media or save it to their device's gallery for future use.

## How to use
Open the app and click on the "Upload" button to select an image. Once the image is selected, enter your desired text in the text box and customize it using the options available. Once you're happy with your creation, click on the "Share" button to post it on social media or the "Save" button to save it to your device.
